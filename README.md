# Snort-based-Intrusion-Detection-System-ft.-ML Models

 
 In this project we have:
 
- Implemented different ML classification algorithms for intrusion detection using  SNORT

- Demonstrated and evaluated the live working of our modified NIDS by performing DoS attacks from Kali Linux Machine to Ubuntu Machine


Datset used for training the Machine Learning Model:

- NSL-KDD (Publicly availavle)


Tools Used:

- SNORT (Packet logger and packet sniffer mode) 


Attack Performed:

- DoS Attack(SYN FLOOD)


The code and the related details are available in the folder Code.
