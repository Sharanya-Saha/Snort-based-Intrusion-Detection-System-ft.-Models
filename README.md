# Snort-based-Intrusion-Detection-System-ft.-ML Models

 In this project we have :
 
- Implemented different ML classification algorithms for intrusion detection using  SNORT

- Demonstrated and evaluated the live working of our modified NIDS by performing DoS attacks from Kali Linux Machine to Ubuntu Machine
